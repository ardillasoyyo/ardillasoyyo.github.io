            </div>
            <p>I think it's been two years, or more (I can't remember), since we met. It took us a while to connect but once we did we had a lot of fun.<br> It was a little strange our initial "fun", but it's better to remember it on the surface than to remember the little details.</p>
            <p>When you got enough confidence you started telling your story, because of how reserved you are,<br> I think it must have taken you a while, so I appreciate your confidence.</p><br>

            <br><p>You motivated me to do the abyss for the first time, when I succeeded I think I motivated you to do the same.<br> Starting an unfriendly competition for who is more powerful. No need to say who is winning :3</p>

            <p>When it occurred to you to start programming, a brief but nice stage began between us.</p>
            <p>Helping you to understand some basic concepts and seeing you with headaches trying to understand it was a lot of fun for me.</p>

            <p>First of all, thank you for sharing that magical cup with me. It was unforgettable, we spent together a month that will remain forever in history.<br> We saw the best national team in history, in the best World Cup in history, in the worst venue in history.</p>

            <p>Our most productive part. Thanks to your patience and initiative I learned a lot, which helped me to do my course in a less traumatic way.</p>
            <p>You also learned at least one thing, that "a/an" is the same as putting "one", don't play dumb.</p>
